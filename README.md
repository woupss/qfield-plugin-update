With this plugin you can update your existents plugins from: 
a selection list.
or copy/paste an url from github release .zip 

If you update directly your plugin via the selection list in the dialog of the plugin and if there is a preload url,
it will download the main.zip of the github repo and save it in a new file with the repo plugin name-main (ex: qfield-repopluginname-main)
and normally it will delete the original plugin file.

There is a limitation, if you have copy/paste the folder of the plugin manually, the plugin can't delete it and you have to delete it manually (Android restriction).
It a plugin in development and any help is welcome
