With this plugin you can update your plugins from: 
a selection list.
or copy/paste an url from github release .zip to install a new plugin or update

Also, you can install a new plugin by copy/past his last release link

There is a limitation, if you have copy/paste the folder of the plugin manually, the plugin can't delete it and you have to delete it manually (Android restriction).

It is a plugin in development and any help is welcome.
